Create your Java classes

  You will have to create a number of Java files to implement a WSRF
  service. These include

  * an interface for your WSRF service

  * an implementation class for the service

  * an implementation of the Home interface

  * a ResourceProperty class for each nontrivial resource property


Full example

  It is easiest to look at the worked example in doc/example to find out how to
best go about it.

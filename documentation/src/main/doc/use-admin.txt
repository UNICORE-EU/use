Administration
--------------

Controlling memory usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set a limit on the number of service instances (e.g. jobs) per user.
This allows you to make sure your server stays nicely up and running even if 
flooded by jobs. To enable, edit +CONF/container.properties+ and
add properties, e.g.

---------------
container.wsrf.maxInstancesPerUser.JobManagement=200
container.wsrf.maxInstancesPerUser.ClientFileTransfer=20
--------------

The last part of the property name is the service name.
  
When the limits are reached, the server will report an error to the client (e.g. when
trying to submit a new job). 

[[use_logging]]
Logging
~~~~~~~

UNICORE uses the Log4j logging framework (version 2). By default, it
is configured using a config file +CONF/logging.properties+. To change
this default, edit the start script (+BIN/start.sh+) or, on Windows,
the +CONF/wrapper.conf+. The config file is specified with a Java
property +log4j.configurationFile+.


[NOTE]
===========
You can change the logging configuration at runtime by editing the logging.properties file.
The new configuration will take effect a few seconds after the file has been modified.
===========

By default, log files are written to the the +LOGS+ directory. 

Within the logging pattern, you can use special variables to output information.
In addition to the variables defined by Log4j (such as '%d'), UNICORE defines several variables
related to the client and the current job.

[options="header"]
|===============================
| Variable         | Description
|%X\{clientName\}  |the distinguished name of the current client
|%X\{jobID\}	   | the unique ID of the currently processed job
|===============================


A sample logging pattern might be

-------------------
 "%d [%X{clientName}] [%X{jobID}] [%t] %-5p %c{1} %x - %m%n"
-------------------

   
Log4j supports a very wide range of logging options, such as date based or size based file rollover,
logging different things to different files and much more. For full information on Log4j we refer to
the publicly available documentation

- https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html


==== Logger categories, names and levels

Logger names are hierarchical. In UNICORE, prefixes are used (e.g. "unicore.security") 
to which the Java class name is appended. For example, the XUUDB connector in UNICORE/X logs to 
the "unicore.security.XUUDBAuthoriser" logger. 

Therefore the logging output produced can be controlled in a fine-grained manner. 
Log levels in Log4j are (in increasing level of severity) TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, 
ERROR, and FATAL.

For example, to debug a security/authorisation problem in the UNICORE/X security layer, 
you can set
  
------
log4j.logger.unicore.security=DEBUG
------

If you are just interested in XUUDB related output, you can set

------
logger.xuudb.name=unicore.security.XUUDBAuthoriser
logger.xuudb.level=DEBUG
------

so the XUUDBAuthoriser will log on DEBUG level, while the other security components
log on INFO level.  

Here is a table of the various logger categories


[options="header"]
|===============================
|Log category      | Description
|unicore           | All of UNICORE 
|unicore.security  | Security layer 
|unicore.services  | Service operational information 
|unicore.services.jobexecution | Information related to job execution 
|unicore.services.jobexecution.USAGE | Usage logging (see next section)
|unicore.xnjs      | XNJS subsystem (execution engine) 
|unicore.xnjs.tsi  | TSI subsystem (batch system connector) 
|unicore.client    | Client calls (to other servers) 
|unicore.wsrflite  | Underlying services environment (WSRF framework) 
|====================================================================

[NOTE]
===========
Please take care to not set the global level to TRACE or DEBUG for long times, 
as this will produce a lot of output.
===========

==== Usage logging

Often it is desirable to keep track of the usage of your UNICORE site. The UNICORE/X
server has a special logger category called +unicore.services.jobexecution.USAGE+ which
logs information about finished jobs at INFO level. If you wish to enable this,
set 

------
logger.usage.name=unicore.services.jobexecution.USAGE
logger.usage.level=INFO
------

It might be convenient to send usage output to a different file than normal log output.
This is easily achieved with log4j:

------
# send usage logger output to a separate file

logger.usage.name=unicore.services.jobexecution.USAGE
logger.usage.level=INFO
logger.usage.appenderRef.usage.ref=USAGE_FILE

appender.FILE2.name = USAGE_FILE
appender.FILE2.type = RollingFile
appender.FILE2.fileName = logs/usage.log
appender.FILE2.filePattern = logs/usage-%d{MM-dd-yy-HH-mm-ss}-%i.log.gz
appender.FILE2.layout.type = PatternLayout
appender.FILE2.layout.pattern =%d - %m%n
appender.FILE2.policies.type = Policies
appender.FILE2.policies.time.type = TimeBasedTriggeringPolicy
appender.FILE2.policies.time.interval = 1
appender.FILE2.strategy.type = DefaultRolloverStrategy
------

For each finished job, the usage logger will log a line with the following information (if available)
----
[result] [executable] [actionUUID] [clientDN] [BSSJobId] [clientXlogin] [jobName] [machineName] 
----

An example output line is:


Administration and monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
The health of a UNICORE container, and things like running services, lifetimes, etc. can be 
monitored in several ways.
  
==== Commandline client (UCC)

It is possible to use the UNICORE commandline client (UCC) to run administrative commands,
list jobs, extend lifetimes, etc.

To gain the required admin permissions, there are two possibilities.

The first way is to configure UCC so that it uses the _server_ certificate of the UNICORE/X server,
so that UCC will have administrator rights. Also you should connect directly to UNICORE/X, not to 
the registry as usual. Here is an example UCC configuration file. Say your UNICORE/X server is 
running on _myhost_ on port 7777, your preferences file would look like this

--------------------
registry=https://myhost:7777/services/Registry?res=default_registry
keystore=path/to/unicorex/keystore
storetype=...
password=...
-------------------

Note that the registry URL points directly to the UNICORE/X server, not to a gateway.

Alternatively, you can use UCC as a "normal" user, but give this user a role "admin" in the UNICORE
attribute source(s).

For example, if you're using a mapfile, you could add the admin role like this

-----
<entry key="CN=Some User, O=Some org, C=EU">
    <attribute name="role">
      <value>user</value>
      <value>admin</value>
    </attribute>
    <attribute name="xlogin">
      <value>user123</value>
    </attribute>
</entry>
-----

In this example, the user can choose between the "user" and "admin" roles ("user" being default). In UCC,
this selection is done by adding "-Z role:admin" at the end of each command.

===== Examples

The main UCC commands that are useful are the _list-jobs_,
_list-sites_ and _rest_ commands.  Using _list-jobs_ you can search
for jobs with given properties, whereas the _rest__ command allows to
look at any resource, or even destroy resources.

UCC also includes support for the Admin Service in UNICORE/X, please
refer to the UCC documentation for details.

==== Java Management Extensions (JMX)

Using the Java Management Extensions, you can monitor any Java virtual
machine using (for example) a program called "jconsole" that is part
of the Java SDK.  It allows to check memory and thread usage, as well
as access to application specific management components ("MBeans").

For details on how to enable JMX access, we refer to the general Java
documentation.

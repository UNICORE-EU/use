This file explains steps which has to be undertaken to update VO subsystem configuration
used in UNICORE/X 6.1.x to the version suitable for UNICORE/X 6.2.0.
All the changes are described in such a way that after update the system should 
operate as 6.1 was.
For details about new features offered by the new options please read the documentation.

******************************
I) Changes in vo.config file.
******************************

1.a) If the old vo.config file contains the entry
	vo.pull.xlogin=true 
then ADD also a line: 
	vo.pull.role=true

1.b) If the old vo.config file contains the entry
	vo.pull.xlogin=false 
then ADD also a line:
	vo.pull.role=false
	
2.a) If the old vo.config file contains the entry
	vo.push.allowXlogin=true 
then REMOVE this line and ADD two new lines: 
	vo.push.xlogin=true
	vo.push.role=true

2.b) If the old vo.config file contains the entry
	vo.push.allowXlogin=false 
then REMOVE this line and ADD two new lines: 
	vo.push.xlogin=false
	vo.push.role=false
	
3) ADD the following line:
	vo.pull.enableTrustDelegation=true
Note that this will enable a new feature which was absent in the previous UNICORE/X versions.
But this feature is nearly always welcome.

4) ADD the following line:
	vo.pull.disableIfAttributesWerePushed=true
Note that this will enable a new feature which was absent in the previous UNICORE/X versions.
But this feature is nearly always welcome (check manual for details).

5) CHANGE the following line:
	vo.serverURI=<YOUR-HOST-URI>
to:
	vo.localServerURI=<YOUR-HOST-URI>
	
(the property name was changed as the old one was misleading)

******************************
II) Changes in uas.config file.
******************************

1) Change package name of VO authorizers (defined as a value of the property 
uas.security.authoriser). Instead of 
	pl.edu.icm.uasvo.authorisers.SAMLPushAuthoriser
use 
	eu.unicore.uas.security.vo.SAMLPushAuthoriser
	
and instead of
	pl.edu.icm.uasvo.authorisers.SAMLPullAuthoriser
use
	eu.unicore.uas.security.vo.SAMLPullAuthoriser
(if you don't use any of the above authorizers just skip it).

2) Change package name of VO initializer (defined as a value of the property
uas.onstartup). Instead of
	pl.edu.icm.uasvo.VOInitOnStartup
use
	eu.unicore.uas.security.vo.VOInitOnStartup
